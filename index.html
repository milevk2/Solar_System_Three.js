                Mercury, the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System, is named after the Roman
                god Mercurius, who is the god of commerce, communication, and the messenger of the gods. Classified as a
                terrestrial planet, it shares roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.

                Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere among all rocky
                bodies in the Solar System. It closely resembles Earth in mass and size, orbiting inferiorly inside
                Earth's orbit. Venus frequently appears as either a "morning star" or an "evening star" in Earth's sky.

                characterized by its vast reserves of water, rendering it a water-dominated world. The extensive global
                ocean covers approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface.

                oxide dust, earning it the moniker "the Red Planet". Notable for its brightness in Earth's sky, Mars is
                frequently observed through telescopes due to its high-contrast albedo features. econd smallest planet

            <h2>Solar System made with Three.js</h2>

            <p>
                I managed to create this project in
                around 5 days starting with 0 knowledge of Three.js . It was such a huge challenge for me, but I did it
                with so much love for programming and for Space and astronomy so I dedicate this project to all of my
                friends who are interested in these topics. Let your dreams be infinite like the Cosmos!
            </p>
            <p>
                This project has been created as a portfolio project for showcasing my skills and understanding on
                integration of a third-party libraries to my projects, code-structure, code readability, code logic
                separation and of other fundamental skills related to html, css and javascript. I dare to say I learned
                so many new things during the development process, which therefore left me really satisfied.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want to thank to www.absrd.co for motivating me to complete this challenge as this project has been
                prepared as a part of the interview process.
